			     Booting Pintos
			     ==============

---- QUESTIONS ---- 
>> Put the screenshots of Pintos running in src/p0.
>> A1: Is there any particular issue that you would like us to know?
The QEMU emulator run extremely slow and makes it hard to type user inputs.

			     Kernel Monitor
			     ==============

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> C1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

uint8_t temp - to capture the user input character
char str[80] - string array to store the whole command from user
count - the current index to store for str

---- ALGORITHMS ----
>> C2: Explain how you read and write to the console for the kernel monitor.
Using input_getc() function, I was able to read the users inputs 1 character
at a time. 

>> C3: Any additional enhancement you implement?
I added extra print statements to identify when the program executes a certain
command or finishes the program.
